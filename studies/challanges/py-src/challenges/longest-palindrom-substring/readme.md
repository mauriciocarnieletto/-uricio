# Longest Palindromic Substring (Daily Interview Pro)

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example:
Input: "banana"
Output: "anana"

Input: "million"
Output: "illi"

```
  class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s): # Fill this in.
```

## Test program

```
  s = "tracecars"
  print(str(Solution().longestPalindrome(s)))

  # racecar
```
